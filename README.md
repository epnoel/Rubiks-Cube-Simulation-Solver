# Rubiks Cube Simulator / Solver
A Rubiks Cube projected orthographically using 2D-graphics library SFML.

**Tip:** When starting the program, you must wait about 30 seconds for the phase tables to load in order to
interact with the simulation





## Controls
- U - rotate top face of cube
- D - rotate bottom face of cube
- L - rotate left face of cube
- R - rotate right face of cube
- F - rotate front face of cube
- B - rotate back face of cube
- Q - rotate cube clockwise
- P - rotate cube counterwise
## Random / Solve Movement
- A - randomly rotate cube 50 moves
- S - solve cube from current state
## Features

- The cube can be controlled using the attached Arduino controller plugged into the computer
